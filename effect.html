        <p>Many insects are considered pests by humans.
        Insects commonly regarded as pests include those that are parasitic (e.g. lice, bed bugs),
        transmit diseases (mosquitoes, flies), damage structures (termites),
        or destroy agricultural goods (locusts, weevils).
        Many entomologists are involved in various forms of pest control,
        as in research for companies to produce insecticides,
        but increasingly rely on methods of biological pest control,
        or biocontrol. Biocontrol uses one organism to reduce the population density of another organism
        — the pest — and is considered a key element of integrated pest management.
        Despite the large amount of effort focused at controlling insects,
        human attempts to kill pests with insecticides can backfire.
        If used carelessly, the poison can kill all kinds of organisms in the area,
        including insects' natural predators, such as birds, mice and other insectivores.</p>

			  <p>Although pest insects attract the most attention,
			many insects are beneficial to the environment and to humans.
			Some insects, like wasps, bees, butterflies and ants, pollinate flowering plants.
			Pollination is a mutualistic relationship between plants and insects.
			As insects gather nectar from different plants of the same species,
			they also spread pollen from plants on which they have previously fed.
			This greatly increases plants' ability to cross-pollinate,
			which maintains and possibly even improves their evolutionary fitness.
			This ultimately affects humans since ensuring healthy crops is critical to agriculture.
			As well as pollination ants help with seed distribution of plants.
			This helps to spread the plants, which increases plant diversity.
			This leads to an overall better environment.
			A serious environmental problem is the decline of populations of pollinator insects,
			and a number of species of insects are now cultured primarily for
			pollination management in order to have sufficient pollinators in the field,
			orchard or greenhouse at bloom time.
			Another solution, as shown in Delaware, has been to raise native plants to help support
			native pollinators like L. vierecki. Insects also produce useful substances such as
			honey, wax, lacquer and silk. Honey bees have been cultured by humans for thousands of years for honey,
			although contracting for crop pollination is becoming more significant for beekeepers.
			The silkworm has greatly affected human history, as silk-driven trade
			established relationships between China and the rest of the world.
			Insectivorous insects, or insects that feed on other insects, are beneficial to humans
			if they eat insects that could cause damage to agriculture and human structures.
			For example, aphids feed on crops and cause problems for farmers,
			but ladybugs feed on aphids, and can be used as a means to get significantly reduce pest aphid
			populations. While birds are perhaps more visible predators of insects,
			insects themselves account for the vast majority of insect consumption.
			Ants also help control animal populations by consuming small vertebrates.
			Without predators to keep them in check, insects can undergo almost unstoppable population explosions.
			Insects are also used in medicine, for example fly larvae (maggots) were formerly used to treat
			wounds to prevent or stop gangrene, as they would only consume dead flesh.
			This treatment is finding modern usage in some hospitals.
			Recently insects have also gained attention as potential sources of drugs and other medicinal substances.
			Adult insects, such as crickets and insect larvae of various kinds,
			are also commonly used as fishing bait.</p>
